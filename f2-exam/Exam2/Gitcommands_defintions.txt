Definitions:

1.) Class - A blueprint for the object, has member variables and methods.

2.) Object - the output from the blueprint, what your variables/properties and methods/create create.

3.) Construction - the function/process of creating the object from variables/functions.  "Constructors are functions in a class that are automatically called when you create a new instance of a class with new. A function becomes a constructor, when it has the same name as the class. If a class has no constructor, the constructor of the base class will be called, if it exists."

4.) Function- the rule/method of creating the object that is reusable.  What should the output be for certain scenerio.

5.) Inheritance-Giving a class a previous more general classes properties, thus allowing one to use all objects within that class.  Human ->Employee.  Employee inherits human class.

6.) Loop-a loop function evaluates an argument runs through that argument and returns to the beginning of the loop and reevalutes until it is not true/valid anymore.

7.)Datatypes- string, array, object, boolean etc.  Data types are used to create variables.

8.)Array-string of values/words

9.)Recursion-going through something and then retracing and having to comeback through each loop set.
